Pega Docker Image
===========

Pega Platform is a distributed web application for customer engagement, customer service, and digital process automation. A Pega deployment consists of a number of containers connecting to a Database and any other required backing services.  The Pega database contains business rule logic that must be preloaded with an installer for the containers to successfully start.  For more information and instructions on how to get started with a container based deployment of Pega, see [Pega's Cloud Choice documentation](https://community.pega.com/knowledgebase/articles/cloud-choice).

[![Docker Image Build](https://github.com/pegasystems/docker-pega-web-ready/actions/workflows/docker-build.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/pegasystems/docker-pega-web-ready/actions/workflows/docker-build.yml) [![Docker Image](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/pegasystems/pega)][pegasystems/pega]

# Using this image

This *ready* Docker image extends a customized Tomcat base image `pegasystems/tomcat:9-jdk11` and contains required components that allow you to run a Pega Platform on your deployment nodes. It does not include Pega Platform rules. This image is web-ready for clients to build a final image that includes the Pega .war file of your choice.

Pega offers an alterative, full image which *includes* the .war file - for details, see [pegasystems/pega on DockerHub][pegasystems/pega]. Docker images provided by Pegasystems are validated and supported by [Pega Support](https://community.pega.com/support).

## Image customizations

If you do not want to use the Pega-provided Docker image, you can copy this repository and build your own image based on your preferred base image such as one enforced by a corporate standard. When making customizations for your environment, check the [Pega Platform Support Guide Resources](https://community.pega.com/knowledgebase/articles/pega-platform-support-guide-resources) to verify that those changes are supported by your Pega Platform version. If you choose to build your own image, Pega will continue to offer support for Pega Platform, but problems that arise from your custom image are not the responsibility of Pegasystems.

## User access and control considerations for this image

Pega provides this *web-ready* Docker image with built-in user privileges - pegauser:pegauser (9001:9001) which allows you to set default, limited user access policies, so file system access can be controlled by non-root users who deploy the image. The image only provides required file access to pegauser:pegauser. When you build your pega deployment Docker image from this *web-ready*, you should consider adding any user access and control restrictions within the image such as required roles ot priveleges for file or directory access and ownership. 

## Building a deployable Docker image using this *web-ready* image

For clients who need to build their own deployment image, Pega recommends building your Pega image using your own Dockerfile with contents similar to the example below and specifying the .war file from the Pega distribution kit. You may also specify a database driver as shown in the example. It is a best practice to build this image on a Linux system to retain proper file permissions. Replace the source paths with the actual paths to the Pega Infinity software libraries and specify a valid JDBC driver for your target database to bake it in.

```Dockerfile
FROM busybox AS builder

# Expand prweb to target directory
COPY /path/to/prweb.war /prweb.war
RUN mkdir prweb
RUN unzip -q -o prweb.war -d /prweb


FROM pegasystems/pega-ready

# Copy prweb to tomcat webapps directory
COPY --chown=pegauser:root --from=builder /prweb ${CATALINA_HOME}/webapps/prweb

RUN chmod -R g+rw   ${CATALINA_HOME}/webapps/prweb

# Make a jdbc driver available to tomcat applications
COPY --chown=pegauser:root /path/to/jdbcdriver.jar ${CATALINA_HOME}/lib/

RUN chmod g+rw ${CATALINA_HOME}/webapps/prweb/WEB-INF/classes/prconfig.xml
RUN chmod g+rw ${CATALINA_HOME}/webapps/prweb/WEB-INF/classes/prlog4j2.xml
```

Build the image using the following command:

```bash
docker build -t pega-tomcat .
```

Since this image uses a secure base image, it doesn't include all the packages in the environment. Therefore use the multi-stage docker build to include only unzipped packages in the final image to reduce the risk of vulnerabilities. 
Upon successful completion of the above command, you will have a Docker image that is registered in your local registry named pega-tomcat:latest, which you can view using the `docker images` command.

## Running the image

You must use an orchestration tool to run Pega applications using containers. Pega provides support for deployments on Kubernetes using either Helm charts or direct yaml files.  You can find the source code for the deployment scripts in the [pega-helm-charts](https://github.com/pegasystems/pega-helm-charts) repository. For information about deploying Pega Platform on a client managed cloud, see the [Cloud Choice](https://community.pega.com/knowledgebase/articles/cloud-choice) community article.

## Mount points

Mount points are used to link a directory within the Docker container to a durable location on a filesystem. For complete information, see the Docker documentation, [bind mounts](https://docs.docker.com/v17.09/engine/admin/volumes/bind-mounts/).

Mount point 	| Purpose
--- 			| ---
`/opt/pega/kafkadata` 	| Used to persist Kafka data when you run stream nodes.
`/heapdumps` 	| Used as the default output directory when you generate a heapdump.
`/search_index`	| Used to persist a search index when the node hosts searched.

## Environment variables

You customize your docker image by overriding environmental variables using the -e Docker flag.
```bash
$ docker run -e "var_1=foo" -e "var_2=bar" <image name>[:tags]
```

### Cassandra settings

For Pega Platform deployments running Pega Decisioning, you must specify how to connect to your organization's existing Cassandra service by using parameters to manage the connection to the service.

Name | Purpose | Default
---  |---      |---
CASSANDRA_CLUSTER | Enable a connection to your organization's Cassandra service. | `false`
CASSANDRA_NODES | Specify A comma separated list of hosts in your Cassandra service cluster (for example, `10.20.205.26,10.20.205.233`). |
CASSANDRA_PORT | Specify the TCP port to connect to your Cassandra service cluster. | `9042`
CASSANDRA_USERNAME | Specify the plain text username for authentication with your Cassandra service cluster. For better security, avoid plain text usernames and leave this parameter blank; then include the username in an external secrets manager with the key CASSANDRA_USERNAME. |
CASSANDRA_PASSWORD | Specify the plain text password for authentication with your Cassandra service cluster. For better security, avoid plain text passwords and leave this parameter blank; then include the password in an external secrets manager with the key CASSANDRA_PASSWORD. |
CASSANDRA_ASYNC_PROCESSING_ENABLED | Enable asynchronous processing of records in DDS Dataset save operation. Failures to store individual records will not interrupt Dataset save operations. | `false`
CASSANDRA_KEYSPACES_PREFIX | Specify a prefix to use when creating Pega-managed keyspaces in Cassandra. |
CASSANDRA_EXTENDED_TOKEN_AWARE_POLICY | Enable an extended token aware policy for use when a Cassandra range query runs. When enabled this policy selects a token from the token range to determine which Cassandra node to send the request. Before you can enable this policy, you must configure the token range partitioner. | `false`
CASSANDRA_LATENCY_AWARE_POLICY | Enable a latency awareness policy, which collects the latencies of the queries for each Cassandra node and maintains a per-node latency score (an average). | `false`
CASSANDRA_CUSTOM_RETRY_POLICY | Enable the use of a customized retry policy for your Pega Platform deployment. After enabling this policy in your deployment configuration, Cassandra queries that timeout will be retried. The number of retries may be configured using the dynamic system setting (DSS): dnode/cassandra_custom_retry_policy/retryCount. If not configured, queries will be retried once. | `false`
CASSANDRA_SPECULATIVE_EXECUTION_POLICY | Enable the speculative execution policy for retrieving data from your Cassandra service. When enabled, the Pega Platform will send a query to multiple nodes in your Cassandra service and process the first query response. This provides lower perceived latencies at the client, but puts greater load on your Cassandra service. | `false`
CASSANDRA_JMX_METRICS_ENABLED | Enable reporting of DDS SDK metrics to a Java Management Extension (JMX) format for use by your organization to monitor your Cassandra service. Setting this property `false` disables metrics being exposed through the JMX interface; disabling also limits the metrics being collected using the DDS landing page. | `true`
CASSANDRA_CSV_METRICS_ENABLED | Enable reporting of DDS SDK metrics to a Comma Separated Value (CSV) format for use by your organization to monitor your Cassandra service. If you enable this property, use the Pega Platform DSS: dnode/ddsclient/metrics/csv_directory to customize the filepath to which the deployment writes CSV files. By default, after you enable this property, CSV files will be written to the Pega Platform work directory. | `false`
CASSANDRA_LOG_METRICS_ENABLED | Enable reporting of DDS SDK metrics to your Pega Platform logs. |


### Hazelcast settings

The clustering used in a Pega environment is powered by a technology called `Hazelcast`. Hazelcast can be used in an embedded mode with no additional configuration required.  Some larger deployments of more than 20 Pega containers may start to benefit from improved performance and stability of running Hazelcast in a dedicated ReplicaSet. For more information about deploying Pega with Hazelcast as an external server, see the Helm charts and the Pega Community documentation.

Name 				| Purpose 		| Default
--- 				| --- 			| ---
HZ_CLIENT_MODE | Enables client mode for infinity  | `false`
HZ_DISCOVERY_K8S | Indicates infinity client will use K8s discovery plugin to look for hazelcast nodes |
HZ_CLUSTER_NAME| Hazelcast cluster name |
HZ_SERVER_HOSTNAME| Hazelcast server hostname |
HZ_CS_AUTH_USERNAME | Hazelcast username for authentication |
HZ_CS_AUTH_PASSWORD | Hazelcast password for authentication |
