generalwhitelist: # Accepted CVEs
  CVE-2018-20217: While the reported severity is CVSS 5.3 Medium, the difficulty to exploit within the container appears very high. This is an availability impact; any crash will result in container restart, not in bypass of credential check. 
  CVE-2018-11236: While the reported severity is CVSS 9.8 Critical in the realpath() API, it is not known how an attacker could send malicious data to that API via Pega. Abstraction from Pega prevents direct path interactions with the FileStorage adapter.
  CVE-2018-20839: Exploitation would require access to keyboard or console, and both seem of negligible risk in a container.
  CVE-2018-11237: While the reported severity is CVSS 7.8 High, this buffer overflow in a specific memcpy API would be difficult for an attacker to reach. 
  CVE-2018-19591: The attack complexity is high and impact is low -- sustained and repeated attack would be needed to cause server slowdown or crash. Abstraction from Pega makes it unclear how the attacker would reach the vulnerable API.
